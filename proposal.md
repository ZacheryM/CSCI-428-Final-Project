<h1>OOD Project Proposal - Wordle Clone</h1>
    <h2>Project Description:<h2>
        <p>I want to make a Wordle-esque game for my project. Wordle is a word game similar to crossword puzzles where you get six tries to guess a random word. The offical game is a daily challenge, with only one attempt and one word per day. I'd like to make a Wordle that has some different features.</p>
        <p>There will need to be some database of words, either a file(.json) or some online source. UI will consist of a tile screen and a keyboard plus a header that allows you to edit settings and provides other details. I currently plan to have four classes, a Tile class, a Keyboard class, Settings class, and GameOver class.</p>
        <p>With how simple the project is I beleive more team members might actually hinder development. I currently intend to work on this project alone, although I am open to collaboration if I find a class mate who is interested and can provide some suggestions on what to improve. Maybe a multiplayer head to head version?</p>
    <h2>Proposed New Features (in no order of importance):<h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty Settings, I want to be able to choice word difficulty based on the words commonality or use in modern conversational language. </li>
            <li>Multiple words per day, take a list of words and allow the player to randomly get a new one. Infinite replayability. </li>
            <li>Word length and attempts settings, allow the player to choose how many attempts they have and how long the word is. </li>
            <li>Options to share the game link and give their friends the same word to try alongside them. This is a common part of the base Worlde game, people like to make it social.</li>
            <li>Multiple language support, use multiple online dictionaries to support some other common languages, e.g. spanish. </li>
            <li>Allow for the user to feed their own set of words to the site for usage. </li>
            <li>A hint button for players who are stuck and want a little more help.</li>
            <li>Accessibility, allow support for disabled users, e.g. blind. (Allow screen readers to understand the page.)</li>
        </ul>
